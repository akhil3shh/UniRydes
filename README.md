# Serverless Web Application for Unicorn rides!

Created a simple serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides.   
Used AWS Amplify for continuous deployment and hosting of web resources.   
Built a public backend API using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway for JavaScript execution.   
Provided user management and authentication functions using Amazon Cognito.   
Used DynamoDB to provide a persistant layer for storage by the API's Lambda function.
